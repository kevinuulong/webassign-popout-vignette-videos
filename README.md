# webassign-popout-vignette-videos
 A userscript to pop out the iframes from my physics book on WebAssign. (Who thought making them so tiny was a good idea?)

 This is a solution to a pretty niche problem, it is unlikely to be of much use to most people. Feel free to modify it for your own use cases.

 This should work with the following book(s) on the WebAssign platform:

    Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics - 10e
    by Serway and Jewett

 Theoretically it could work with other books on the platform, but I have not tested.
